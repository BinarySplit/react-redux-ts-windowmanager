    <p>This is a practice project for React/Redux/TypeScript.</p>
    <p>What should work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Moving &amp; resizing windows</li>
        <li>Opening &amp; closing windows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What probably won't work (yet):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-Chrome browsers</li>
        <li>Minimizing/maximizing windows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where this is going:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a> desktop environment, for housing other projects</li>
        <li>Replacing React with Preact &amp; TypeScript with Flow</li>
