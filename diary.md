Goals:
    Use React, Redux, TypeScript in a project
    The project is a window manager, as it contains many moving parts and will serve as the basis for other projects

Thoughts:
    * Have to ditch the Redux yeoman generator as I'm renaming the autogenerated files to .ts/.tsx
    * TypeScript resists metaprogramming - no introspection or dynamic type creation
    * TypeScript + Redux is a bad combo:
        ** the @connect decorator doesn't play nicely with types - the decorated class can't see the added fields
            *** workaround: don't use the decorator
        ** the "makeActionCreator" pattern doesn't play nicely with types

        ** IMO, this solves a lot of problems. It will be my preferred structure for new Redux projects
        ** It's almost essential for dividing code into bundles
            *** Not sure how bundling and on-demand-loading Redux reducers & action creators would work though...
