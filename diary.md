Goals:
    Use React, Redux, TypeScript in a project
    The project is a window manager, as it contains many moving parts and will serve as the basis for other projects

Thoughts:
    * Have to ditch the Redux yeoman generator as I'm renaming the autogenerated files to .ts/.tsx
    * TypeScript resists metaprogramming - no introspection or dynamic type creation
    * TypeScript + Redux is a bad combo:
        ** the @connect decorator doesn't play nicely with types - the decorated class can't see the added fields
            *** workaround: add "props" declaration to class
        ** the "makeActionCreator" pattern doesn't play nicely with types
        **
